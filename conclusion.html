        <p class="text-white">
          And now here we are, at the end. Though this page does not do the video full justice, I believe it's useful to go back through and identify several cases where the narrative, subject position, and intertextuality were used. I'm going to pick a few examples that I believe are noteworthy, though you may have identified many yourself, especially if you watched the video. Many of these are directly utilized in my paper.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-white">
          Narrative
        </h1>

        <p class="text-white">
          Let's first begin with the narrative. I believed that it followed a very Syntagmatic pattern throughout the video. Specifically, this can be found in parts such as the transition from a diagnosis to tramatic flashbacks, where the transition is almost seamless. "It's not at all uncommon for those with trauma to initially find themselves unable to remember the events the traumatized them, as a result of afformentioned dissassociative amnesia. But when they do start to remember..." and so on. That statement is the active transition from one section to the next. I also discussed the sections themselves. While many may have followed from one page to the next, some may jump from point to point before going back to get context. More importantly, the sections act as a bookmark to keep track of where you are in case you needed to leave the page. It also tracks your progress, so you know where you are along the way.
        </p>
      </br>

        <h1 class="text-white">
          Subject Position
        </h1>

        <p class="text-white">
          I believed that one of the most interesting ways that the video managed to pull the viewer into its preferred subject position was through the use of Sunny's diagnosis. As we were given many possible diagnoses and then had them broken down, it gave the viewer the freedom to consider them and gain a deeper understanding, as well as giving them the freedom to consider their own hypotheses. In addition, the mention of Sunny's fears and tying it to concepts we are all familiar with, such as warring parts and simple fears such as drowning, it creates an idea that is easier for them to understand and appreciate.
        </p>
        </br>

        <h1 class="text-white">
          Intertextuality
        </h1>

        <p class="text-white">
          Finally, Intertextuality is probably the most blatent one to find examples of. I initially pointed out how he utilized it for ethos by referring to numerous sources from clinicians and therapists who have experience and extensive knowledge on the subject. In addition, I pointed to many aspects of Omori that Elieson pulled from the game, including audio and visuals. I included many key visuals, including replicating the in game text boxes as an example. I believe the best example of this was the fight against Something in the Trauma Recovery section. Finally, I believe that Omori and the topics discussed by clinicians and their descriptions aided both in building credibility. The best example of this is Judith Herman stating that many of her patients felt their very lives were in danger anticipating their redollextion of the truth, while later this becomes an important quote from the fight against Something, as Sunny prepares himself to remember the truth.

              Finally, I want to just say a few things. First of all, thank you for following this rabbit hole all the way to the end, especially if you aren't grading or reviewing it. I would also like to thank Clark Elieson for the fantastic video, naturally this paper and website would be very different without it, and I might have been in a much worse position mentally than I am now without its comfort over the many months. In that same vein, I would like to thank Omocat for creating such an amazing and well thought out game that has touched and helped many. Overall, this project has been a fantastic help to me in many ways, besides completing a school project. Thank you for reading.
