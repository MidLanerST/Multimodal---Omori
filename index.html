              If you randomly stumbled on this page then you may be wondering, what exactly is this? This is a website that steps through a video titled "The Game with a Perfect Portrayal of Trauma" by Clark Elieson as an interactive version of my paper on the video. Feel free to explore each page. If you are curious about the original paper, you can find my contact information in the drop down by clicking the icon in the top right.

            <p class="text-white">
              The rest of this page is dedicated to getting familiar with the video and subject matter before diving in. I'll also give you a chance to watch the video yourself.
          </br>
          </br>
            One final disclaimer. Omori, the video, and sections of this page may include images harm and multilation. In addition, parts of each may be difficult for those who have experience with trauma, anxiety, and depression. Please keep that in mind as you continue, and remember to stop, take breaks, and come back later if you need to.

            I initially discovered this video and Omori during a particularly troubling time in my life. I had made some mistakes that had been haunting me for months and it was eating away at me. So the title "The Game with a Perfect Portrayal of Trauma", really reached me at that time. Without anything better to do, I clicked on the video to escape from my thoughts for a time. After finishing the video, I immediately decided to play Omori for myself. Both really helped. and meant a lot to me. I've spent quite a bit of time just rewatching the video and playing Omori respectively, while working on improving.

            When considering rhetoric and a topic for discussing rhetoric in some form of media, I instantly thought of this video. I was interested in looking into how this video managed to have such a large impact both on myself, and others in the comments. How was it that Clark Elieson managed to create this video essay that was both extremely convincing, captivating, and touch on many themes that can be difficult to discuss? Throughout the course of my paper, I explored this question using three rhetorical lenses. What I hope to recreate throughout your time exploring the next sections is the experience of discovering these connections, and utilizing them myself throughout, in order to gain a deeper understanding of these techniques.

        <div>
        <p class="text-white">
          The three lenses that we will explore were defined by Barry Brummet in his book <i>Rhetoric in Popular Culture</i>. A citation for this can be found in the Conclusion section. These lenses are:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="pList">
              <p class="text-white">
                Narrative: Syntagmatic and Paradigmatic
              </p>
            </li>
            <p class="text-white">
              This lense incorporates both Syntagmatic and Paradigmatic patterns, which can both exist at the same time. A Syntagmatic pattern is one that focuses on "the appeal of 'what comes next'". In essence, when you're interested in knowing the conclusion of a story or idea, or want to know what happens next, that is the Syntagmatic pattern. A Paradigmatic pattern is one that "looks at structures or patterns derived by comparing and contrasting a given sign or text with other signs or texts that are like it". Some examples of these are when a character succeeds in something they were shown to fail before, or the viewer could compare it to a similar scene in another text where that character succeeded or failed.
            </p>
            <li class="pList">
              <p class="text-white">
              Subject Position
              </p>
            </li>
            <p class="text-white">
              This lense focuses on texts "asking those that read them to be certain kinds of subjects". In other words, they want the viewer to think or react a specific way, so that they can experience the story as it was intended, or to view it a certain way. It also includes subversive stances, which are stances directly opposite to the preferred subject position. Makeover shows may want their viewer to value style and aesthetics, but a subversive stance taken by a viewer may include choosing to mock the host and participants.
            </p>
            <li class="pList">
              <p class="text-white">
              Intertextuality
              </p>
            </li>
            <p class="text-white">
              Intertextuality is when a text "references, makes use of, or actually includes part or all of another text". For example, this entire essay and website has intertextuality with Clark Elieson's video, Omori, Elieson's sources he uses, Brummett, and so on. This can be done to build credibility, such as my use of Brummett's lenses, explain something more clearly, such as borrowing scenes from Omori or Elieson's video, and more.
            </p>
          </ol>
        </div>

          <div>
            <p class="text-white">
              Keep these lenses on your mind as you continue to explore the website. Before we continue, I want to provide you with the option to watch the video and play Omori before continuing. There will be spoilers by continuing on, and by watching the video. I myself do not care a lot for spoilers before starting the game, but even I feel like watching the video before playing Omori did the game a disservice. Even with many areas and plot points left unspoiled. Still, if you need some motivation and interest before you play it that the website and Steam page for the game don't provide, then the video is definitely worth a watch before purchasing it.
