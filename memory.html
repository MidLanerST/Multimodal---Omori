          Eventually, Omori and the gang's search for Basil leads them to the Deeper Well, the deepest aspect of Headspace. To descend any lower into Sunny's consciousness would be to enter the incoherent realm of his subconscious.

            When it comes to Trauma, remembering the truth is agonizing, but the more horrifying thought here is what would happen if you actually let yourself get away from it. What would be left if all there was were your dreams? "The end of this journey will lead to suffering.... but if you do not face this, you cannot continue. This form, though it has not shown its true self, is evil. You will not see this unless you fight it."

          <p class="text-white pImage">
            Omori seems to have constructed the structure of Headspace after the psychoanalytic theories of Freud and Yung. This diagram seems to be what Omori follows as it physically embodies Sunny's psychology. Yung believed that there were depths to consciousness, with the unseen part of the mind's processes found in the subconscious. Things that are unpleasant to the eye of consciousness are held here so as to prevent one from troubling oneself. A phenomenon that often goes by the name of repression.

            <p class="text-white pImage">
              Sunny's persistent efforts to actualize his redemption lead him to that part of his mind. Black Space. This nether world plagued with suppressed horrors, cruel urges, demonic memories, and chaotic happenings, yet to be formed in a comprehensible thought. Each door leads to another personification of Omori's fears and memories, twisted through a grim lense. In comparison to White Space, which was sterile, empty, and controlled, Black Space is spontaneous, crowded, and full of uncertainty. It is here that one is able to see the true depths of their own twisted nature, and the twisted nature of life itself.

            Basil's important connection to the truth cannot be understated. In the real world, Basil acts nervous around Sunny, and in his bathroom breakdowns points out that there's Something behind Sunny. There's clearly something that ties Sunny's guilt and Basil together. "No matter how many times the path is concealed, the flower boy will always find it.". Which is why, in Black Space, Omori kills Basil again, and again, and again, and again.

            "The meeting with oneself is at first the meeting with one's own shadow. The Shadow is a tight passage, a narrow door, whose painful construction no one is spared who goes down to the deep well. But one must learn to know oneself in order to know who one is"

            And indeed, who exactly is Sunny? Or perhaps a better question to ask, is who is Omori?
