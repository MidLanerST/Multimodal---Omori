            In the Lost Forest, Daddy Longlegs explains that Headspace was built over Black Space, meant to seal up its influence. For a long time, it is said that Sunny himself explored Headspace. But when the darkness of Black Space failed to abate, he chose to entirely forget himself as a means of protection. Thus spawning Omori, and using him to live his dreams out in attempted ignorance.
          </p>

            And with Omori later getting skills such as Erase, and his tendency to murder Basil in Black Space, it is implied that Omori acts as the guardian of Sunny's thoughts. He is the one that carrys Sunny back to White Space, every time we expose ourselves to a part of the truth. In a disturbing reveal, Omori then goes on to ascend a red stair case, and sit atop a red throne. It is at this moment that the full split within Sunny finally takes place. The struggles between these parts of himself a battle over Sunny's right to see the truth. It comes as no surprise therefore, that when Sunny has entirely remembered the truth, Omori weaponizes it, becoming the game's final boss.

        <p class="text-white">
          I said that this endgame dynamic between Omori and Sunny caused some members of the community to posit that Sunny therefore suffers from full or partial DID. I concluded that since there isn't enough evidence to conform to the current clinical understanding of this disorder, it was unlikely to be true. Omori and Sunny do not offer enough differences in personality to qualify them as differing personality states.

            However, their interactions do lead me to believe that their relationship is more representative of Cognitive Dissonance. Dr. Van Der Kolk further solidifies this as a viable opinion by offering an interesting perspective on DID on the wider framework of PTSD in his book, <i>The Body Keeps The Score</i>. "As dramatic as its symptoms are, the internal splitting and emergence of distinctive identities experienced in DID represent only the extreme end of the spectrum of mental life. The sense of being inhabited by warring impulses or parts is common to all of us, but particularly to traumatized people, who had to resort to extreme measures in order to survive.". Many behaviors that end up becoming classified as psychiatric problems initially start out as strategies for self-preservation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-white">
          Just as it is crucial for recovery to revisit traumatic memories and learn how to live with them without being overwhelmed by their recollection, it is also crucial that one revisit the part of oneself that developed the maladaptive habits that previously helped them to survive. That there are different parts of the whole self is an idea that has been in circulation for a while. This is why you can say that a part of you admires someone, while another part of you is disgusted and irritated by them. But in trauma, the self-system is broken down, and parts of the self become polarized. Everyone has a part of themselves that is childlike and innocent. Guardians like Omori operates as a means to protect that part of the self, but this way of coping can quickly become maladaptive and tyrannical. Judith Herman wrote in her book that many of her patients felt as if their very lives were in danger, merely anticipating their recollection of the truth. It is important for persons with trauma to sort out that confusing inner blend so that they are able to say this part of me feels worthless while this other part of me feels angry.
