One of the later characters in the game will tell you that to be in white space is to be nothing. White Space is emptiness, a home without warmth. A place to survive, but not to live. This sterile void is where Sunny, as Omori, escapes from anything that may bring back memories of his trauma in his subconscious. Omori's laptop reveals that he has spent an eternity here, every entry concluding: "Everything was okay.". This journal also tell us that when he isn't locking himself away in White Space, he's visiting his friends. He spends his time adventuring through Head Space with these friends throughout the course of the game, particularly the bottom three. There's

            But the real world segments of the game aren't so cheerful. Mari is dead. Sunny hasn't left his house in four years. And his friends, the same ones we met in Headspace, are broken versions of their former selves, still reeling from Mari's suicide. The game begins with three days remaining until Sunny moves away from Faraway town.

              In the beginning sequences of the game in Headspace, you'll help Basil put back together his photo album, which got disorganized after an quarrel between Aubrey and Kel. But once you've finished, Basil will notice another photo on the ground. Picking it up causes a strange shadow to gather around him, and his fear-filled eyes turn red, as he yells out Mari's name.</p>

              <p class="text-white">
              But the next time you visit Headspace, Basil is nowhere to be found. The group elects to search for him. However, as you continue, your friends begin to forget what Basil looks like and what he likes to do, until he is entirely erased from their memories, as you get caught up in other conquests. But no bandage can stifle an eternal wound, and there will be a time when its influence will bleed through. Basil's shadowy apparition always appears that the conclusion of Sunny's dreams, reminding him of a piece of the harrowing reality he represses.
