            Taking a look at the DSM-5, it's reasonable to say that Sunny suffers from PTSD. The DSM-5's diagnostic criteria for PTSD states that the individual:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="pList">
              <p class="text-white">
                Must have have exposure to a potentially traumatic event.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="pList">
              <p class="text-white">
                Must suffer from one or more intrusive symptoms including intense and prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="pList">
              <p class="text-white">
                Must avoid stimuli related to the traumatic event.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="pList">
              <p class="text-white">
                Must suffer from negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event.
              </p>

          </ul>

            Checking through his available symptoms, it's obvious Sunny fits the majority of these criterion. There's been quite a lot of discussion among fans of the game discussing a diagnosis for Sunny, with the most attention given to Dissassociative Amnesia, and Dissassociative Identity Disorder (DID). However, it's unlikely that either of these diagnoses totally apply to Sunny, for the following reasons.

            However, disassociative amnesia is not a diagnosis. It is a symptom, often occurring as the offspring of PTSD. As a result, it's important to make the distinction between these medical terms as symptoms and what is called Pure Dissassociative Amnesia. Pure Dissassociative Amnesia is probably closer to Kermit in the movie <i>The Muppets take Manhatten</i> wherein Kermit is hit by a car and completely forgoes his identity and everything else about his life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-white">
              To say Sunny suffers from the symptoms of dissassociative amnesia, is simply to say that he can't remember what happened.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col" style="border: 2px solid white; text-align: center;">
            <h3 class="text-white">
              Dissassociative Identity Disorder

            </h1>
            <p class="text-white">
              Those in the Omori fandom who have assigned this diagnosis, formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder, to Sunny, have done so in response to questions concerning Omori's function, origin, and role in Sunny's psyche. But the general outview on full DID has been on the symptom of switching between personalities. This is often marked by bouts of amnesia, where one could forget things that could previously have been remembered by an alter. The amnesia in DID is so prevalent, that it's suggest that it ought to be among the essential factors a clinician considers before assigning the diagnosis.

          Nonetheless, there is one thing that is shared in common between these disorders, and the thing that Sunny certifiably meets the requirements for. Psychological Trauma. It's not at all uncommon for those with trauma to initially find themselves unable to remember the events the traumatized them, as a result of afformentioned dissassociative amnesia. But when they do start to remember...
